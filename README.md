# PORTFOLIO!

## First Steps
### I started out by wireframing my portfolio website on paper, this would help me to try out different layouts before diving in to my code. I also established a desired color palette using a website I like to use for design (coolors, see palette below)

## Website functions
### Closely following the provided guidelines, I first began with the header which will allow the user to navigate amongst the different sections of the website. I also included a hand drawn gif which plays when first entering the website for an interesting visual aesthetic affect. The ABOUT, WORK, and CONTACT tabs when clicked will pull the UI to that section of the page.

### As directed, I included a recent photo of myself and a short bio description. Using flexbox I was able to place these side by side to offer the user an opportunity to feel slightly more connected with the person crafting the website. 

### In my past work section, my first application image displays larger than the others. Since I do not have much experience with web design and development I included a link to a youtube video of mine to take up more space as well as show the user my versitile skill set. In addition, this allowed me to practice the application of the iframe element (which was a good skill refresh). Clicking on these application images takes the user to the given website. The images are also set to change transparency when hovered over.

### The site is also designed and set to be responsive to differing screen sizes using media queries. This was definitely my greatest challenge, but again this was great practice. Adjusting to using percentages vs. pixels greatly helped my overall site responsiveness = and allowed images to not become distorted.
